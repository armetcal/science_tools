# This Shiny application is designed to process Attune flow cytometry data (though other machine outputs are likely to work as well).

Documentation is yet to be uploaded.

Two sets of sample data are supplied:
1. single_iso - these data include isotype controls (suffix = ' iso') and include a range of metadata.
2. double_no_iso - these data come from two .csv files, have shared sample names, and have a gate name that represents two different cell populations (R7).
